        <h3>Key Definitions</h3>
        <p>
          Before proceeding with the conflict identification questions, please review these important definitions that will guide your assessment:

        <div class="definition-box">
          <h4>Interest</h4>
          <p>
            An interest is a commitment or concern that you have. It can be something that you care about, are responsible for, or that affects you in some way. Interests can be financial, professional, personal, or relational in nature.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="definition-box">
          <h4>Competing Interest</h4>
          <p>
            A competing interest exists when you have two or more interests that could potentially conflict with each other or require different courses of action. These interests may pull you in different directions or create tension in your decision-making.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="definition-box">
          <h4>Conflict of Interest</h4>
          <p>
            A conflict of interest exists when your ability to fulfill one commitment or responsibility could be compromised by your other interests, relationships, or obligations. This occurs when competing interests could reasonably be perceived to influence your professional judgment or decision-making.
