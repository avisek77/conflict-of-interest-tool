        CONTEGRITY has been written as though you are considering a new activity that could create a conflict of
        interest. A new activity can be a new role, relationship, agreement, etc.<br><br>
        CONTEGRITY can also be used to reflect on situations in which you may already have a conflict of interest,
        and/or in which you are considering taking on several activities simultaneously. Here you should choose one
        activity as if it were new.<br><br>
        If you are completing this on behalf of an organisation, consider "you" to mean your organisation in the
        following questions.
