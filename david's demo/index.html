        <h2>Full Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                CONTEGRITY is a practical decision support tool that helps individuals and organisations to better address conflicts of interest (COI), to meet their professional obligations and to maintain trust.
                The CONTEGRITY tool bridges the gap between organisational policies, guidelines, checklists and case studies on COI and the actual situations in which competing and conflicting interests need to be addressed.
                By providing a practical way of thinking through the identification, appraisal and management of COI, CONTEGRITY supports the implementation of relevant policies and procedures.
                Please select "Next" to continue to the CONTEGRITY tool. There are <span class="highlight"><strong>78</strong></span> questions in this survey.

                <strong>Introduction and agreements</strong><br/>
                CONTEGRITY is organised into several sections. The first collects some information about you and the new activity you are considering. The second helps you to identify whether a conflict of interest exists.
                The third helps weigh up benefits and risks. In the final section you will be helped to develop a plan for managing the conflict of interest. There are also two additional sections to help you identity and manage potential and perceived conflicts of interest.
                As you work through these sections you will automatically be directed to relevant sub sections and bypass those that are not.
                Once you have finished entering your data, you can print or save the questionnaire. You will be able to use this as a management plan for several purposes, for example, seeking approval for activities and negotiating partnerships.
                It is, therefore, worth taking the time to answer the questions in detail. Please note you can stop and save at any time and return to complete your responses later using the link in the email we sent you.

                <strong>Data storage and security</strong><br/>
                No data is being permanently stored. Everything is being temporarily stored on you laptop / computer / phone and no information travels accross the network. There may be an additional, completely seperate survey / prompt at the end of the 
                Conflict of Interest Survey which would give you the option to use some of the information gathered for research purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Printing and saving the questionnaire</strong><br/>
                Once you have completed the CONTEGRITY survey you will receive a prompt asking whether you wish for your responses to be submitted to CONTEGRITY so that the responses may be used in formal research projects (you will be asked in advance to participate if this is the case).
            
                Unless you are participating in a research project and submit the survey, it is important that you print the PDF of your responses as once you exit, you will no longer be able to access the survey and it will be permanently deleted from all systems.
                Additionally, you may receive a prompt or email requesting you to complete an optional user experience survey.
