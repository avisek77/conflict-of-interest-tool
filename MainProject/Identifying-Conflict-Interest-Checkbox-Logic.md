    [Help:  
        New interests can include 1. self-oriented concerns and 2. other-oriented commitments.

        New self-oriented concerns might include the desire or need to:
            Gain financially or avoid financial loss
            Protect or promote your reputation
            Support or promulgate your beliefs
            Benefit physically or psychologically or avoid harm
            Build or maintain relationships

        New other-oriented commitments might include the desire or need to:
            Devote time and resources to tasks
            Conduct tasks effectively, efficiently and/or ethically (e.g. objectively, fairly)
            Make appropriate use of information and/or other resources, including tangible resources such as money, equipment, or facilities, and intangibles such as data, time,
            policies, procedures or brands
            Demonstrate loyalty to an individual, group or organisation (e.g. promoting their goals, interests, values and beliefs; protecting their reputations; not assisting or favouring
            their competitors; reciprocating for goods and services received)

        The kinds of circumstances that give rise to such interests might include:
            Receiving funding or in-kind support
            Being employed by an organisation
            Holding shares in or owning an organisation
            Being a member of an organisation or committee
            Being a consultant (paid or unpaid) to an organisation
            Being in a personal or professional relationship
            Holding particular beliefs
            Having particular health or other needs (or having someone close to you with such needs)

        Negative effects on the existing activity might include:
            Devoting less time or resources to it
            Conducting it less effectively, efficiently or ethically (e.g. objectively, fairly)
            Misusing information and other resources (e.g. money, equipment, facilities, data, policies, procedures, brands etc)
            Being disloyal to individuals or groups (e.g. not promoting their goals, values and beliefs, not protecting their reputations; assisting or favouring their competitors)
