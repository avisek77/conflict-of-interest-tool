Discussions of COI generally focus on harms, but it is important also to consider the benefits in order to establish whether the proposed new activity provides enough benefit to justify the risk of harms and the effort it takes to manage them. Before you consider harms, you will therefore be asked about the likely benefits of taking on the new activity. The following taxonomy will help you to assess benefits and harms: Strategic benefits/harms: Positive/negative effects on your ability to conduct your work and achieve your occupational goals or obligations. (Financial risks/benefits to you or to an organisation belong in this category.)
